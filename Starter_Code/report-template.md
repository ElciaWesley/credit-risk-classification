## Module 20 CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS
__________________________________________
## Overview & Purpose of Analysis
__________________________________________
Lending companies give money and/or assets to borrowers, expecting them to pay it back. Credit Risk is the chance that borrowers won't repay, causing financial loss for the companies. The data in this case likely includes financial variables such as credit scores, payment history, income levels, loan amounts, etc., and the goal is to predict whether a borrower is likely to have good or bad credit. Using Machine Learning, you can analyze past lending data to predict which borrowers are more likely to repay.Gathering relevant financial data for analysis.

I used a Logistic Regression Model on a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending company, achieving a 95% accuracy rate. However, the model's ability to identify non-healthy loans was less precise due to an imbalance in the dataset, where healthy loans were much more common.

## Results
___________________________________________
Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Logistic Regression Model:
The Logistic Regression model trained on the given dataset accurately classified healthy loans 100% of the time but had an 85% accuracy in predicting non-healthy loans.
The imbalance of healthy vs non-healthy loan data can lead to mistakes such as classifying non-healthy loans as healthy loans.
## Summary
The Logistic Regression model using the given dataset performed well but could ultimately lead to inaccurate classifications.
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning. I would recommemd these models.
